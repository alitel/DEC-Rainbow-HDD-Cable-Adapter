# DEC-Rainbow-HDD-Cable-Adapter
This PCB can be used to connect an MFM hard drive (or emulator) to a Dec rainbow 100 using standard ribbon cables.

I followed the cable building guide found here: https://oldcomputers-ddns.org/public/pub/mirror/os2site/sw/dec/rainbow/rainbow.faq

(The instructions are also found in Cable Instructions.txt)
